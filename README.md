Udacity DAND Project 5 â€“ Identify Fraud from Enron Email

This is my submission for Project 5 ('Identify Fraud from Enron Email') on Udacity's Data Analyst Nanodegree. The project brief asked the student to build an algorithm to identify Enron Employees who may have committed fraud based on the public Enron financial and email dataset.

The intended project outcomes were to demonstrate the student's ability to:
* Deal with an imperfect, real-world dataset  
* Validate a machine learning result using test data  
* Evaluate a machine learning result using quantitative metrics  
* Create, select and transform features  
* Compare the performance of machine learning algorithms  
* Tune machine learning algorithms for maximum performance  
* Communicate machine learning algorithm results clearly
